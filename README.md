# Console-Platformer-Game-Made-in-Assembly-Irvine32-
Name says it all yo.
Doesnt have Graphics since i dont know how to do that.
You can move around and jump (jumps pretty wonky tho lol).
Theres Gravity.
Theres Platforms that descend.
Theres Collisions with platforms , coins and an enemy.
You can restart the game and it calculates your score.
There is an enemy thats pretty spooky , beware of him i guess.
This was made for a 2nd year University Project for Assembly Language.
It was inspired by this video:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCkvtRDo_GQ
Subscribble to him , he is pretty cool.
